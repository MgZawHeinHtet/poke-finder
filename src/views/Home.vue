Fire-type moves are based on attacks of fire itself, and most of them can leave the status Burn.</p>

It is also one of the three Starter types, forming a perfectly triangular relationship with Fire and Grass. There are more Pokémon of this type than any other type due to the large number of marine creatures to base species from.</p>

                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg grass">GrassType</span> :Several Grass types are paired with the Poison type (Pokémon such as Oddish, Venusaur and Bellsprout), reflecting the toxicity of several plants towards mainly humans. Most Grass-types are also simply animals with plant life attached to them (Pokémon such as Bulbasaur, Paras, Sceptile, Gogoat and Tropius).</p>

Prior to changes in Generation IV, all damaging Electric-type moves were special, but they may now also be physical depending on the attack.</p>

                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg ice">IceType</span> :Ice-type Pokémon are immune to Hail weather damage. In Generation II, Ice-type Pokémon cannot get frozen by Ice-type moves, but they can get frozen by Tri Attack. Starting in Generation III, Ice-type Pokémon cannot get frozen. As of Generation VII, Ice-type Pokémon are immune to Sheer Cold.</p>

                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg fighting">FightingType</span> :Fighting Pokémon are strong and muscle-bound, often based on martial artists. Fighting moves are super-effective against five other types (as is Ground), making them very good offensively. Most Fighting type moves are in the Physical category, for obvious reasons.</p>

                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg poison">PoisonType</span> :The Poison type (どくタイプ Doku taipu) is one of the eighteen Pokémon elemental types. These Pokémon have a natural toxic quality; some directly represent real-world species known for their venom, such as snakes, and some even represent pollution itself. They normally live in caves, marshes or similar places.</p>

                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg ground">GroundType</span> :The Ground type (じめんタイプ Jimen taipu) is one of the eighteen Pokémon elemental types. Ground-type Pokémon have powers and abilities related to control of ground and earth. Ground-type Pokémon are afraid of water, like Rock-type Pokémon, unless they are Water type. Many Ground Pokémon are also partially Rock type.</p>

                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg flying">FlyingType</span> :Flying-type Pokémon are Pokémon that can fly and live at high altitudes. They are normally birds or dragon-like (i.e. the Water-and Flying-type Pokémon, Gyarados). ... However, all Flying-type Pokémon are immune to all Ground-type moves and are strong against Grass, Bug and Fighting types.</p>

                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg psychic">PsychicType</span> :The Psychic type (エスパータイプ Esupaa taipu) is one of the eighteen Pokémon elemental types. Many Pokémon are of this type, and, being the type with most Legendary Pokémon, for many, the Psychic-type is the most powerful. Psychic-type Pokémon tend to be very intelligent.</p>

                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg bug">BugType</span> :The Bug type (むしタイプ Mushi taipu) is one of the eighteen Pokémon elemental types. Bug-type Pokémon are characterized by their fast growing, as they don't take long to evolve. Bug-type Pokémon live mostly (not all of them) in forests, some of them are a little harder to find because they live atop the trees.</p>
                        <hr class="yellowHr">
                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg rock">RockType</span> :Tied with Grass, Rock types have the most weaknesses of any type, with five. ... Rock-type Pokémon, on average, have the lowest Speed of all Pokémon and of fully evolved Pokémon, but typically among the highest Defense and above-average Special Defense, as well as resistance against four common types.</p>
                        <hr class="yellowHr">
                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg ghost">GhostType</span> :The Ghost type (ゴーストタイプ Gosuto taipu) is one of the eighteen Pokémon elemental types. The Ghost type is notable for having few Pokémon, many of whom have low HP, and moves. In battles, the Ghost-type is useful because it's the only type that has two immunities: Normal and Fighting, both of which are common move types.</p>
                        <hr class="yellowHr">
                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg dark">DarkType</span> :The Dark type was introduced in the second generation of Pokémon games as a measure to balance the types. In particular, its resistance to Psychic cut down that type's advantage by a long way. When paired with the Ghost type it was the only type combination to have no weaknesses prior to Gen 6.</p>
                        <hr class="yellowHr">
                        <p class="text-white pt-1"><span class="poke-bg dragon">DragonType</span> :The Dragon type (ドラゴンタイプ Doragon taipu) is one of the eighteen Pokémon elemental types. The Dragon-type is often considered an ancestral type as many Legendary Dragon-type Pokémon are revered as deities. Other Dragon-type Pokémon are frequently hard to catch and train. They also evolve late and are relatively rare.</p>
